# CFB-filter-model

This repository contains the source codes for the computations of the filter model utilized in my doctoral dissertation. The codes generate datasets from the raw data of high-resolution TFM simulations, which are then processed for regression in the neural network model. All data preparations are implemented with [Wolfram Engine 13](https://www.wolfram.com/engine), which is a free alternative to Wolfram Mathematica.

Except for the codes, the repository supported an example with raw data (in data folder), filtered data (in table folder), and gradient data (in tableGrad folder).
