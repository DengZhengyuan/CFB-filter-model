# CFB-filter-model

This repository contains the source codes for the computations of the filter model utilized in my doctoral dissertation. The codes generate datasets from the raw data of high-resolution TFM simulations, which are then processed for regression in the neural network model. All data preparations are implemented with [Wolfram Engine 13](https://www.wolfram.com/engine).

Except for the codes, the repository supported an example with raw data (in data folder), filtered data (in table folder), and gradient data (in tableGrad folder).
